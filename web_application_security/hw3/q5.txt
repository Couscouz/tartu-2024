curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_token.php -d "comment=TestingNoToken"
curl https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_token.php -c cookie.txt
curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_token.php -b cookie.txt -d "comment=TestingWithToken&csrf_token=TOKEN"

To explain:
The first CURL command is trying to post a comment without giving csrf token value, so this returns an error.
We could also try to pass something like "comment=TestingNoToken&csrf_token=TestRandomToken"

In order to success, we need to get a cookie value and retrieve csrf token value of this cookie
by grepping it in the output of the 2nd CURL command.
Here I did it manually but we could combine with another command to grep it automatically.

Finally, we use this cookie associated with this token in order to post the comment, as in 3rd CURL command

We can say this is token-based validation
