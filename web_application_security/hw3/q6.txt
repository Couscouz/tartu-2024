curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_referer.php -d "comment=NoRefererHeader" -e "https://google.com"
curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_referer.php -d "comment=RefererHeaderSet" -e "https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_referer.php"

To explain :

In the first CURL command I'm trying to POST comment with Referer header set to google website
This returns an error because google is not the host website.

In the second one, I'm setting the Referer header as the website itself, and so, I can POST my comment


So we can say this website is using the referer-based validation
