COOKIE=$(curl https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_samesite.php -s -o /dev/null -c cookie.txt && grep -i "samesite" cookie.txt | awk '{print $NF}'
)
curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_samesite.php -b "cookie_name=$COOKIE" -d "comment=FinalTestingQ7"
curl -X POST https://webappsec.cs.ut.ee/csrf/comments_samesite.php -b "samesite_sessid=$COOKIE" -d "comment=TestingLine3"

To explain :

In the first command we are retrieving the cookie.
For this last I made up a full command to store the cookie automatically.
So for this, we're storing the cookie in cookie.txt as usual, then
I'm grepping the line with the cookie, and extracting the last word of this line, which is our cookie


In the second command, I'm trying to post a comment with a cookie_name value stored previously, which is not working

Finally, I'm trying to post a comment with a samesite_sessid value (cookie which has a SamSite=Lax), and this is working !

So we can say this website is using SameSite=Lax cookie
